Topic : Hotel Bill Generate
System
Research: A hotel bill generator in C
programming is a software application
designed to automate the billing process
for hotel services. This program typically
includes functionalities to manage
customer data, room bookings, service
charges, and the generation of final bills

Analysis:
Data Structures:

 Hotel Information: This includes details
such as room types, rates, availability,
and additional services offered (e.g.,
meals, laundry).
 Customer Information: This typically
consists of customer names, contact
details, booking dates, and payment
records.
 Billing Information: This encompasses
the calculation of total costs based on
room rates and services availed.

Ideate:
 User Interaction: The program
should allow users to input their
choices through a console interface.
 Dynamic Pricing Calculation: It should
calculate prices based on user
selections (e.g., number of nights
stayed, additional services).

 Error Handling: The program should
handle invalid inputs gracefully,
prompting users to re-enter data when
necessary.
 Bill Generation: Finally, it should
generate a formatted bill that includes
all relevant details like
Customer name, room type, duration
of stay, service charges, and total
amount due.
